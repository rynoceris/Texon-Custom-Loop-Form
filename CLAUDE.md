# Claude Code Development Documentation

This file documents the development process and methodology used by Claude Code in maintaining and improving the Custom Laundry Loops Form plugin.

## ü§ñ About Claude Code

**Claude Code** is Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, designed specifically for software engineering tasks. This plugin was developed and maintained through a collaborative process between the plugin owner (Ryan Ours) and Claude Code.

- **Model**: Claude Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
- **Platform**: Claude Code CLI
- **Development Period**: September 2025
- **Session Focus**: Multi-session cart quantity calculation issues

## üéØ Development Approach

### Systematic Problem Solving
Claude Code employs a methodical approach to debugging and development:

1. **Issue Identification**: Thorough analysis of user-reported problems
2. **Root Cause Investigation**: Deep-dive debugging through log analysis
3. **Solution Architecture**: Design of comprehensive, multi-layered fixes
4. **Implementation**: Step-by-step code changes with real-time testing
5. **Validation**: Extensive testing across multiple scenarios
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive changelog and technical documentation

### Real-Time Debugging Methodology
```bash
# Example debugging workflow
tail -50 "/path/to/debug.log"  # Monitor live logs
# Analyze cart state changes
# Identify session conflicts
# Implement targeted fixes
# Verify resolution
```

## üîß Technical Solutions Implemented

### Multi-Layered Cart Fix System
Claude Code implemented a three-tier protection system to address cart quantity issues:

```php
// Layer 1: Early Template Redirect
add_action('template_redirect', 'cllf_fix_checkout_early', 1);

// Layer 2: Cart Validation Hook  
add_action('woocommerce_check_cart_items', 'cllf_fix_cart_during_validation', 1);

// Layer 3: Final Safety Net
add_action('woocommerce_checkout_before_customer_details', 'cllf_final_cart_fix', 1);
```

### Dynamic Protection Bypass
Implemented intelligent protection system that allows automated fixes while preventing manual tampering:

```php
// Set skip protection flag before programmatic updates
if (WC()->session) {
    WC()->session->set('cllf_skip_protection_once', true);
    error_log('CART REFRESH: Set skip protection flag during cart fix');
}
```

### Session State Management
Enhanced cart persistence across multiple user sessions:

```php
// Force save cart to session to prevent reversion
if (WC()->session) {
    WC()->session->set('cart', WC()->cart->get_cart_for_session());
    WC()->session->save_data();
}
```

## üìä Problem Analysis & Resolution

### Original Issues Identified
1. **Multi-Session Cart Conflicts**: Users adding loops across different sessions
2. **Checkout Processing Interference**: Cart fixes being skipped during order placement
3. **Protection System Conflicts**: Error messages appearing for correct cart states
4. **Session Restoration Problems**: WooCommerce reverting cart quantities

### Debugging Process
Claude Code used comprehensive log analysis to track down issues:

```bash
# Cart state monitoring
CART REFRESH: Cart contents hash: d45583a442b5df5cc2a068ec84749e3b
CART REFRESH: Found sublimation tags: x79 (Product ID: 49360)
CART REFRESH: Total loops counted: 79
CART REFRESH: Sublimation tags are already correct
```

### Solution Architecture
The final solution involved:
- **Removing Skip Logic**: Eliminated checkout processing restrictions
- **Multi-Hook Coverage**: Ensured cart fixes run at multiple intervention points
- **Session Persistence**: Enhanced cart data retention
- **Protection Intelligence**: Smart bypassing of validation during fixes

## üß™ Testing Methodology

### Comprehensive Test Scenarios
Claude Code guided the testing of multiple scenarios:

1. **Single Session Testing**: Standard cart functionality
2. **Multi-Session Testing**: Cross-session cart persistence  
3. **Incognito Session Testing**: Browser session simulation
4. **Order Placement Testing**: End-to-end transaction validation
5. **Error Recovery Testing**: Cart fix effectiveness validation

### Real-Time Log Monitoring
```bash
# Example monitoring during testing
[09-Sep-2025 21:10:41 UTC] CART REFRESH: Found sublimation tags: x85
[09-Sep-2025 21:10:41 UTC] CART REFRESH: Total loops counted: 85
[09-Sep-2025 21:10:41 UTC] CART REFRESH: Sublimation tags are already correct
```

## üìã Development Workflow

### Iterative Development Process
1. **Problem Reproduction**: Recreate user-reported issues
2. **Log Analysis**: Identify patterns in debug output
3. **Hypothesis Formation**: Develop theories about root causes
4. **Solution Design**: Architect comprehensive fixes
5. **Implementation**: Apply code changes incrementally
6. **Testing**: Validate fixes across multiple scenarios
7. **Refinement**: Optimize solutions based on test results
