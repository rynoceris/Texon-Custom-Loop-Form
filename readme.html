        <h3>Version 2.1 - May 5, 2025</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>v2.1 updates - See notes</li>
            <li>QUESTION FONT: Please make the font larger for all form questions (22px). I think it&#039;s easy to skip over a question because the font is kind of small/similar to the notes on the rest of the form.</li>
            <li>This has been done, and was a great recommendation!</li>
            <li>STRAP COLOR REFERENCE PHOTO - can you make it clickable to zoom/enlarge? Or maybe have a link that says &quot;Click here for color reference&quot; that would bring up this photo.</li>
            <li>This has been implemented, let me know if you see anything that should be changed!</li>
            <li>STRAP COLOR: Update the color &quot;Tan (Jute)&quot; to &quot;Tan (Old Gold)&quot;</li>
            <li>This is done</li>
            <li>SPORT OR WORD QUESTION: Change the example text in the &quot;Sport or Word on Strap&quot; field to say &quot;Example: &quot;VOLLEYBALL&quot; or &quot;PRACTICE&quot; or &quot;TRAVEL&quot; and then change the note below the field to say &quot;Note: For best results, limit to 20 characters&quot;</li>
            <li>This is done. I actually limited the text entry limit for this question and the &quot;Names&quot; fields to be no more than 20 characters. The customer will see a character count, and messaging about this max limit.</li>
            <li>NUMBERS: Is there any way to make this section work so that when choosing numbers, you can hold Shift and select multiples? Not a major concern, but it would be nice!</li>
            <li>Yes! This was a great suggestion and has been implemented.</li>
            <li>FONT PICKER: I&#039;m glad to hear that PlayerKits is on board with the customer adding their own fonts! I think there will be some schools that have already uploaded their font, and they just want us to use it - can you add an option for the customer to indicate &quot;Use Font Previously Provided&quot; and &quot;I Need to Upload a New Font&quot; (which would then allow the file upload) or something like that...</li>
            <li>I have included a new dropdown for this question with the options &quot;Use Default Font(s)&quot;, &quot;Use Font(s) Previously Provided&quot;, and &quot;I Need to Upload a New Font&quot;. The custom font upload field is only displayed if the customer selects &quot;I Need to Upload a New Font&quot; from the dropdown. Also improved the field hints/messages.</li>
            <li>FONT COLOR: In the font color picker section, is it better to just have a field where the customer can type in the color? This is really cool functionality, but I think it might be overly complicated. Whatever the color is, it is likely going to be one that references the color in the logo - which PlayerKits can sample. I worry that having Hex codes and RGB will be too overwhelming for many of our customers. What do you think?</li>
            <li>This is a tough one. On one hand, I would think that they would know the proper CMYK, RGB or HEX value for their school or team&#039;s colors. But on the other hand, I see your point, and some people ordering may be less informed or know these values. Since I&#039;ve already coded this, let&#039;s give it a shot as-is for awhile and see how customers interact with it.</li>
            <li>On a side note, did you notice that if you upload a logo file, it extracts the colors from the image and presents them as options for the font color? Do you like this part of the functionality?</li>
            <li>NUMBER OF SETS: Jen thinks we should add more options to the &quot;Number of Sets&quot; question. Maybe make this a dropdown like you have the &quot;Blanks&quot; question.</li>
            <li>I have changed this to be a dropdown, with the numbers 1-25 as options. Let me know if I need to add more options here.</li>
            <li>LOOP PREVIEW: Jen was concerned about this (Wayne absolutely LOVES this functionality, so it&#039;s definitely staying!) but I&#039;m fine to keep it. If customers are confused by it, we might consider taking it down at a later date. That said, I think we need to: Make the disclaimer text &quot;Preview is for visualization purposes only. Actual product may vary slightly&quot; larger and RED.</li>
            <li>I made this 16px and red, great suggestion.</li>
            <li>It might have been too crazy to do, but I thought you said you could change the preview to show the shorter tag image for Numbers and the larger tag image for Names. Not a huge deal, just asking!</li>
            <li>I have now implemented this functionality as follows:</li>
            <li>If the customer selects &quot;Names&quot;, a large loop preview image is shown (regardless of whether they selected a &quot;Single&quot; or &quot;Double&quot; clip above).</li>
            <li>If the customer selects &quot;Numbers&quot;, a small loop preview image is shown for &quot;Single&quot; clip loops, and a large loop preview image is shown for &quot;Double&quot; clip loops.</li>
            <li>Let me know if you need/want any changes to this logic/functionality</li>
            <li>ADD TO CART / CHECKOUT / NEXT STEPS: This section keeps confusing me and I&#039;m getting caught up here. I think it&#039;s because I already pressed &quot;Add to Cart&quot; so it kind of seems like it didn&#039;t work. Let&#039;s try this: After adding an order to the cart, can you: Hide the &quot;Clear Form&quot; and &quot;Add to Cart&quot; buttons above the success message, as well as:</li>
            <li>Great suggestion, these are now hidden after clicking the &quot;Add to Cart&quot; button.</li>
            <li>Include another green button to the left that says &quot;Start a New Loop Order&quot; - this button would essentially clear the form and take them to the top.  What do you think?</li>
            <li>Also a great suggestion, this has been implemented as well as a &quot;View Cart&quot; button that can take them to their cart. I also added success messaging that says &quot;Your custom loops have been added to the cart!&quot;.</li>
            <li>MINIMUM ORDER FEE: Jen mentioned a &quot;Minimum Order Fee&quot; for orders under 30. Does this form/process account for that?</li>
            <li>I implemented this the way that Wayne asked me to. He asked me to do the following:</li>
            <li>If the customer orders less than 24 loops, the per-product sublimation fee is $3.95/ea</li>
            <li>If the customer orders 24 or more loops, the per-product sublimation fee is $1.95/ea</li>
            <li>If this is different than what Jen wants or is expecting, please ask her to consult Wayne about this. If they decide together to make a change, I&#039;ll update the code to match.</li>
